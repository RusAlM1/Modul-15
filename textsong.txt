I spoke to God today and She said that She's ashamed
What have I become?
What have I done?
I spoke to the devil today and he swears he's not to blame
And I understood 'cause I feel the same
Arms wide open
I stand alone
I'm no hero and I'm not made of stone
Right or wrong
I can hardly tell
I'm on the wrong side of Heaven and the righteous side of hell
The wrong side of Heaven and the righteous side
The righteous side of hell
